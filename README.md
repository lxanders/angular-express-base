# angular-express-base

This is a small demo project for an [`AngularJS`](https://angularjs.org/) single page application (spa).

It is bundled by [`webpack`](https://webpack.github.io/), initially served by an [`Express.js`](http://expressjs.com/) server and shows some basic functionality of Angular. It includes a ready to go development workflow.

Note: This project uses ES5 and does currently lack tests for client side code.

### Getting started

* Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:lxanders/angular-express-base.git`
* Install required modules: `npm install`
* Start playing with this project by starting the server in development mode (with hot reloading): `npm run dev:hotreload`
